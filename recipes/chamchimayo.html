<h2>Here we have a delicous snack called 참치마요 (quite literally tuna mayo)</h2>
<p>This recipe is very easy to make. It goes well with a bit of Netflix, a chilly day, a warm day, just whenever!</p>
<p>A relatively healty snack! Except for the mayonaise. Don't eat too much of it! Tuna can have high levels of mercury. You could add other seafood, but then it wouldn't be called 참치마요, now would it?</p>
